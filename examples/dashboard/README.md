# Dashboard deployment example

This example shows how to use the `mittwald/opensearch/mittwald` module to deploy an OpenSearch dashboard.

To deploy a dashboard instance, set the `opensearch_dashboard_enabled` input variable to true. This example also shows you how to make the dashboard available at a public URL using a `mittwald_virtualhost` resource.
