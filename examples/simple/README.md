# Simple usage example

This example shows a minimal usage of the `mittwald/opensearch/mittwald` module.

It will provision a single-node OpenSearch instance in a container, which will then be available for internal use in your hosting environment. To connect to your OpenSearch instance, use the `module.opensearch.opensearch_url` output variable.
